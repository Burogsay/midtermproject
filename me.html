            <h1>FROM DREAMS TO REALITY</h1>
            <p>Rostum Burogsay , I'm an anime lover, I'm an independent person. Stumbled sometimes but will rise again for my dream. No matter how many trials or problems come my way, I will never be destroyed by any trials that come my way. There are so many failures I faced but this is the way for it I will learn. I am a student who has many dreams to achieve for my family. I have goal in my life, goal with purpose. It gives me a reason to get out of bed every morning, excited  about the challenges and opportunities the day may bring. It makes the hard work and sacrifices worthwhile, knowing that I am contributing to something larger than myself. I have a positive attitude and always look for the good in every situation.
                The goal I’m currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting the changes with myself. Sure, I’ve had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exactly what made me the way I am now: grateful, full of love, with a desire to study well because it will help me become a successful person in future and have a high quality of life.I am  blessed to have an open and outgoing family. My family always encourages me to do my best in all aspects of life. They teach me moral values and help me make crucial decisions.</p>
